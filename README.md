# An_applcation_of_Faster_RCNN

I have applied Faser RCNN, the method in the link https://github.com/kbardool/Keras-frcnn

You can access the dataset via the following link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/draaslan/blood-cell-detection-dataset

The file named "fcnn_blood_cell.ipynb" is performed using Google colab.

You can track every step inside the file "fcnn_blood_cell.ipynb" after uploading it to Google Colab.
